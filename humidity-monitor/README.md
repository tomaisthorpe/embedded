# Humidity Monitor ðŸš§

A Rust-based humidity monitor using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and Sensirion SHT3x sensor. This project uses the Embassy async runtime framework for efficient embedded programming.

## Features
- Real-time humidity and temperature monitoring using a Sensirion SHT3x
- WiFi connectivity using the Raspberry Pi Pico W's built in CYW43439 chip
- JSON-based configuration

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Sensirion SHT3x
- [Carrier PCB board](./hardware/board/)

```

## Dependencies

- [CYW43 firmware](../cyw43-firmware/) for WiFi

## Building

1. Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and configure your settings
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Running

The project is setup to use `probe-rs` to program the Pico. To flash the Pico, simply run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
